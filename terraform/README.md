# üß± Terraform Infrastructure Configuration

This directory contains Terraform configuration files to deploy a basic infrastructure on **Microsoft Azure**. It provisions a single Linux virtual machine with networking components configured to support a K3s cluster deployment.

## üß© Features

- Provisions a fully functional Azure virtual machine ready for Kubernetes (K3s) deployment
- Automatically creates and configures:
  - Resource group.
  - Virtual network and subnet.
  - Network security group with custom rules.
  - Public IP and network interface.
  - SSH-enabled Linux VM.
- Outputs public IP and VM ID for easy access and automation.
- Modular and customizable through variables.

## üìÇ Structure

- `main.tf` ‚Äì Defines resources including the resource group, virtual network, subnet, network interface, public IP, NSG, and a Linux VM.
- `variables.tf` ‚Äì Defines input variables used to customize the deployment.
- `security-rules.tf` ‚Äì Defines the security rules for the NSG.
- `outputs.tf` ‚Äì Outputs the public IP and VM ID after deployment.
- `providers.tf` ‚Äì Specifies the required providers and versions.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements

- Terraform >= 1.12.0
- A supported cloud provider account (in this case, Microsoft Azure).
- Azure CLI authenticated (`az login`).
- Proper credentials configured (e.g., via environment variables or CLI login).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
# Initialize the configuration
